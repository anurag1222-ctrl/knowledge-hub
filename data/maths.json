    "question": "If you randomly shuffle a standard 52-card deck, what is the probability that no card is in its original position?",
    "answer": "Approximately 36.8% (1/e)",
    "explanation": "This is a classic problem called 'derangements'. The probability approaches 1/e (about 0.367879) as n increases. For n=52, it's extremely close to this value. A derangement is a permutation where no element appears in its original position.",

    "question": "What is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100?",
    "answer": "5050",
    "explanation": "This can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n(n+1)/2. For n=100: 100×101/2 = 5050. Legend has it that young Gauss discovered this method when his teacher asked the class to sum 1 to 100 to keep them busy.",

    "question": "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?",
    "answer": "5 cents",
    "explanation": "Many people instinctively answer 10 cents, but that would make the bat $1.10 (only $1.00 more) for a total of $1.20. Algebraically: Let ball = x, bat = x + 1.00. Then x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10, so 2x + 1.00 = 1.10, 2x = 0.10, x = 0.05.",

    "question": "Three friends check into a hotel room that costs $30. They each contribute $10. Later the clerk realizes the room should only cost $25, so gives the bellboy $5 to return. The bellboy gives each friend $1 and keeps $2. Now each friend paid $9 (total $27) and the bellboy has $2, making $29. Where is the missing dollar?",
    "answer": "There is no missing dollar",
    "explanation": "The confusion comes from adding the bellboy's $2 to the $27 the friends paid. Actually, the friends paid $27 total: $25 for the room and $2 stolen by the bellboy. The remaining $3 was returned to them. So: $25 (room) + $2 (bellboy) + $3 (returned) = $30.",
